Adversarial Search Collection 2023 for "Ranking-Incentivized Document Manipulations for Multiple
Queries" paper.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes a total of 2520 documents submitted by
students (847 of which are unique), 2400 documents generated by
bots (1833 of which are unique), and 30 documents that served as
the initial document per topic.

Format: trectext.
DOCNO Format: ROUND-<round_number>-<query_id>-<author_id>

## Queries
We selected from the UQV dataset topics with commercial intent
that were more likely to incite competition. For each topic, three
queries were used. The first query was the focus of the backstory,
while the other two were selected from all the available query variants. 
The selected queries are available in the file "queries.txt".

## Relevance Judgments
All documents in the collection were judged for relevance by five annotators from Cloudresearch's Connect platform. 
Judges were presented with the topic title and the respective backstory from the UQV dataset and were asked to classify a document as relevant if it satisfies the information need stated in the description.
The relevance grade is the number of judges that classified the document as relevant. 
Relevance grades are available in the file "documents.rel".

## Quality Judgments
Documents written by students were judged for relevance by five annotators from Cloudresearch's Connect platform. 
Annotators were presented with the text of the document and were asked to classify the document as (1) Valid, (2) Keyword-stuffed, (3) Spam.
A document is deemed keyword-stuffed if it contains excessive repetition of words that seem unnatural or artificially introduced.
A document is considered spam if its content cannot possibly satisfy any information need.
If a document is not spam or keyword-stuffed, it is considered as valid.
The quality grade is the number of judges that classified the document as valid. 
Quality grades are available in the file "students_documents.quality".
